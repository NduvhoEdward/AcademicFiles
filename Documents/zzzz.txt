To do our studies, we found and selected the following primary and secondary datasets.


Due to the constraints imposed by our datasets, our studies were restricted to areas like: Provincial cases, Demographic data per districts, and Vaccination sites per district, to mention only some.

So, our aim was to answer questions like: How many vaccination sites are available in each district...........What is the current vaccination capacity of the different communities in SA........And things like population density as well as the number of vaccination sites... and of cos vacc effieciency.
