Good evening guys, I hope youre all well and keeping safe.

About the current arrangement: I think heavily working on this only when we are all together might be end up defeating the idea of a teamwork, or atleast some aspects of it. 

I say that in light of the fact that sometimes debugging can very easily take some hours, which of course we might not be able to do in one meeting. 
And it might be sometimes more efficient if we all are looking at it a problem different perspectives.

So doing some work outside the meeting sessions, while of course keeping a fairly extensive record (and explaination) of the changes you are making (on a shared file), might be more efficient. 
We can then maybe go through the changes made during the weekly meeting(s), to bring everyone up to speed, and to "synchronize"

Let me know what you think, or the direction we could go, so we can finalise the planing, which we need to do soon as Vanessa pointed out




And some good news, we're now able to ping the headnode from the computemode, and vise-versa. 
And also loging into the compute from the headnode is possible. 


Problem cause:
After checking the devices(/interfaces?) with 

	$nmcli device show

 i saw that the changes we were making with "nmtui" were somehow not taking effect (becaauce the gateway address was still 10.0.0.1, even after we changed it to 192.168.0.1).

# restarting the network service (or the OS) was not solving the matter, im not sure why, maybe we needed to deactivate and (re)activate the interface....maybe.

What I did:
I 'restarted networking' with 

	$nmcli networking off 

		# which, (if I may save you the distress in case you try it), closed my "ssh" connection, so I had to log back in through OpenNebula.  

	$nmcli networking on #(from OpenNebula)
